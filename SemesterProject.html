<br> <p style="text-align:center;color:black; font-size:30pt;">Abstract</p>
<br> <p style="text-align:center;color:black; font-size:20pt;"> Problem Definition:
- Wasting money on items that you use few times in a long period of time (for example: drills, Ladders and Grills). 

Existing solution:
 - Some shops can rent items and you give it back after you use them. 

Disadvantages of this solution: 
- Wasting time to go get the item from the shop and asking for a lot of information and If you damaged the time you need to pay it price. 

Our solution:
- A website that you can lend and borrow items for free or you can donate your items.

Minimum features:
- Borrower can search for the items they are looking for.
- Display some information like: the name of owner/borrower, showing the location of the owner and the borrower.
- Owners can add a picture of the item.
- The owner can rate the experiment he had with the borrower and other owners can see the rating of that borrower to accept his request to borrow their items.

Optional features:
- Customize the items into 2 categories: Loaned items and Donated items.
- Dark/white theme </p>
